# Part V: Recommendations & Roadmap

> *“You’ve built something that works. Now what? It’s time to choose your path and plan your evolution.”*

---

Part V helps you take a step back and think **strategically** about your journey in AI/ML. You’ve now built, deployed, and optimized real projects—this section guides you on how to scale your skills, specialize your focus, or pivot toward long-term goals like research, entrepreneurship, or high-performance model training.

Whether you’re a creator, a coder, or a founder—this is your **map forward.**

✅ Chapter 13: Choosing the Right Path Forward  

- Different builders, different directions. Want to keep using APIs for creativity and prototyping? Great. Prefer to train models and control the full pipeline? Also great. This chapter helps you **define your developer identity** and choose a path aligned with your goals.

✅ Chapter 14: Case Studies & Templates  

- We revisit 3 full projects and break them down step-by-step, showing the full tech stack and thought process:

* **AI Meme Generator** (OpenAI + Railway + Vercel)
* **Photo Cartoonizer** (Replicate API + Hugging Face Spaces)
* **Personality Chatbot** (OpenAI + Render + Vercel)
  Each comes with a template you can clone, customize, and deploy for your own use cases.

After Part V, You Will Be Able To:

* Reflect on which path in AI/ML suits your style—API-first, model-first, or hybrid
* Reuse project templates to rapidly create MVPs or personal tools
* Present your projects more confidently to clients, employers, or collaborators
* Plan your next steps—whether it's learning model training, mastering deployment, or launching your own startup
