# Part IV: Cost-Optimized Strategies

> *“Free-tier is not a limit—it’s a challenge. How far can you go before you need to pay?”*

---

Part IV is all about **stretching your resources smartly**. Whether you're bootstrapping an idea, building a demo for clients, or simply learning the ropes, this section teaches you how to **make the most out of free-tier plans**—without compromising quality or performance.

You’ll learn optimization strategies for each platform, how to monitor your usage, and when (and what) to invest in once you start scaling.

✅ Chapter 10: How to Stay Within Free Tiers  

- We break down usage limits for Hugging Face Spaces, Railway, and Render. Learn when to use **Gradio vs FastAPI**, how to avoid **cold starts**, and how to schedule activity to minimize idle time. This chapter gives you tactical strategies to stay 100% free.

✅ Chapter 11: Investing Smartly in Paid APIs  

- If you decide to pay for usage, **pay wisely**. We compare pricing for OpenAI, Replicate, and Stability AI APIs, then show you how to set **rate limits**, implement **usage caps**, and detect runaway costs before they happen. We also introduce billing dashboards and quota alerts.

✅ Chapter 12: Scaling Beyond Free Tiers  

- When you’ve outgrown the free plans, what should you upgrade first? We explore when to go PRO on Hugging Face, move from Railway Hobby to Pro, or start paying for GPU runtime. We also cover **student credits**, the GitHub Student Pack, and grants that help you scale sustainably.

After Part IV, You Will Be Able To:

* Maximize usage within free-tier limits across all major services
* Implement cost-saving techniques like batching, lazy loading, and caching
* Set up budget alerts and usage monitoring
* Know when (and what) to start paying for as your project grows
* Leverage student benefits and cloud credits to keep building without hitting a wall
