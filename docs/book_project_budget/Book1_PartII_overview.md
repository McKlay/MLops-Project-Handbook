# Part II: Step-by-Step AI/ML Project Development

> *“You don’t need a PhD to build an AI app—just a clear path from folder to frontend.”*

---

Part II is where we roll up our sleeves and **build real AI/ML projects from the ground up**. This section walks you through every critical step—from organizing your repository to writing inference code, building a frontend, and integrating with paid APIs.

Unlike generic tutorials, this part focuses on **modularity**, **deployment readiness**, and **cost-efficiency**—giving you repeatable patterns you can apply to any AI idea.

✅ Chapter 3: Setting Up Your Project Repository  

- Learn how to structure your project folders for clean separation between backend and frontend. We’ll create a Python virtual environment, set up `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, and connect your GitHub repo with version control best practices.

✅ Chapter 4: Building the ML Logic  

- This chapter covers both options:  
  (A) Running a local pretrained model like CartoonGAN using PyTorch, or  
  (B) Using a cloud API (OpenAI, Replicate) for inference.  

- You’ll learn how to write clean inference code, test your outputs, and prepare for integration.

✅ Chapter 5: Building the Frontend UI  

- Choose your frontend framework—Vite or Create React App (CRA)—and build an engaging UI that interacts with your AI backend. We’ll cover styling tips (dark mode, export buttons), managing input/output states, and fetching predictions in real-time.

✅ Chapter 6: Integrating with Paid APIs  

- Whether you’re using GPT for chatbot responses or Stability AI for image generation, this chapter shows how to integrate safely and affordably. We’ll also explore `.env` files, secret management, fallback logic, and how to avoid surprise bills.

After Part II, You Will Be Able To:

* Set up a clean, scalable AI/ML project repo with modular structure
* Write and test ML inference code using local or cloud models
* Build frontend interfaces that call your AI backend or API
* Securely manage API keys and environment secrets
* Launch fully working prototypes with minimal cost
