# AI/ML Companion Site ðŸ“˜ðŸš€

This repository contains two structured, book-style documentation projects combined into a single MkDocs-powered website. It is part of my personal AI/MLOps learning journey and job search portfolio.

- `ðŸ“˜ AI/ML Project Toolkit` â€“ Tool-by-tool breakdown of CI/CD, Docker, Gradio, FastAPI, and more.

ðŸ“¦ **Built With:**
- MkDocs + Material Theme
- Hosted via GitHub Pages
