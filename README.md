# AI/ML Builder’s Companion Site

> “From cost-conscious builders to cloud-ready engineers—this is your blueprint for real-world AI.”

**Live Site**: [https://mcklay.github.io/MLops-Project-Handbook/](https://mcklay.github.io/MLops-Project-Handbook/)  
Author: [Clay Mark Sarte](https://github.com/McKlay)  
Built with [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) | Powered by real-world AI projects & MLOps experience

---

## 📘 What This Is

The **AI/ML Builder’s Companion Site** is a dual-book documentation project designed to guide engineers, students, and AI developers through:

1. **Practical AI/ML Project Development**
2. **Modern Deployment and Tooling Strategies**

Each book is modular, deployment-aware, and grounded in actual project experience—from deploying Hugging Face demos to scaling Dockerized APIs.

## Included Books

### 📘 Mastering AI/ML Projects on a Budget  
*A practical guide to building and shipping AI apps using free-tier tools like Hugging Face, Railway, Vercel, and Replicate.*

- Build full AI pipelines—from model to UI  
- Choose between local or API-based inference  
- Deploy backend & frontend on cloud platforms  
- Avoid billing pitfalls using smart cost strategies

### 📘 AI/ML Project Toolkit  
*A tool-by-tool breakdown of the ecosystem: FastAPI, Gradio, CI/CD, Docker, databases, logging, and more.*

- Learn the tools that productionize AI systems  
- Build secure and scalable infrastructures  
- Understand rate limits, GPU runtimes, auth, and cloud hosting  
- Develop a builder’s mindset and ship faster
