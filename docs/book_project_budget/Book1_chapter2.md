# Chapter 2: Essential Tools & Technologies

2.1 Programming Languages You’ll Use

|Language	             |Use Case	                            |Why It Matters                                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|Python	             |AI/ML development, API integration	       |Dominates the AI/ML ecosystem                   |
|JavaScript (React)	      |Frontend UI + interaction	              |Needed for web apps and frontend deployment     |
|Shell/CLI (Bash, CMD)     |Environment management	              |Used in deployment, Git, Docker, etc.           |

Start with Python + React (JS) combo. Most AI projects can be fully built with these two.

|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|PyTorch	              |Deep learning training/inference	              |Used by Hugging Face & many models       |
|Transformers (HF)	       |Pretrained models: BERT, GPT, ViT, etc.	       |Easy to use, huge model library          |
|Gradio	              |UI builder for ML apps	                     |Great for Hugging Face Spaces            |
|OpenAI SDK	              |Call GPT-3.5/4, DALL·E, Whisper	              |Simple API, fast outputs                 |
|Replicate API Client	|Access image models (CartoonGAN, U-GAT-IT)	|Used via HTTP/REST calls                 |
|Scikit-learn	              |Traditional ML (classification, regression)	|Lightweight, not GPU-heavy               |
|FastAPI	              |Build ML APIs with Python	                     |Ideal for backend deployment             |

Use PyTorch + Hugging Face if working with models yourself.
Use OpenAI or Replicate APIs if you want fast & powerful outputs.

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
touch .env                 # Store your API keys here
git init && git remote add origin <your-repo>
```

### Pro Tips on Training Cost-Efficiently

- Train Locally with CPU if your model is tiny. For small datasets + shallow networks, it's fine.

- Use Pretrained Models: Fine-tune, don't train from scratch.

- Freeze Lower Layers: Speeds up training & reduces GPU use.

- Use batch_size=8 or lower on free GPUs.

- Checkpoint Often: Save intermediate models every few epochs.

- Use Gradient Accumulation if memory is tight.

---

### Workflow Suggestion (for Fine-Tuning)

       1. Prototype in Colab Free or Kaggle.  
       2. Upgrade to Colab Pro or rent a GPU on RunPod if needed.  
       3. Save model.pt or model.safetensors.  
       4. Upload model to Hugging Face Hub or host in backend API.  
       5. Deploy API on Railway/Hugging Face Spaces.


## 2.9 Key Takeaways from Chapter 2
- Use Python + React as your core stack.

- Choose between Gradio vs FastAPI depending on how flexible and beautiful your UI needs to be.

- Hugging Face + Vercel gives the cleanest free-tier stack for portfolio-level apps.

- Use .env + requests to securely integrate any paid APIs like OpenAI or Replicate.
