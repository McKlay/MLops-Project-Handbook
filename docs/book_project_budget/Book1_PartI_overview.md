# Part I: Foundations

> *“Before you ship AI to the world, you need to understand the building blocks—tools, models, and the trade-offs that shape your project.”*

---

Part I lays the **foundational mindset and technical awareness** you’ll need before diving into your first AI/ML project. Too many tutorials throw you straight into notebooks without explaining the *why* behind your choices: local vs. cloud inference, code vs. API, free vs. paid—this section fixes that.

You’ll learn how real-world AI projects are structured, what makes them viable, and how to pick the right tools to match your goals and budget.

✅ Chapter 1: Understanding the Landscape of AI/ML Projects  

- Explore what makes an AI/ML project “good.” You'll learn how to balance creativity, feasibility, and deployment readiness. We’ll also walk through popular beginner-friendly use cases like meme generators, cartoonizers, and chatbots—plus how API vs local training decisions shape them.

✅ Chapter 2: Essential Tools & Technologies  

- This chapter gives you the lay of the land. From Python and JavaScript to PyTorch and Hugging Face, you’ll get a working map of the tools you’ll actually use to build AI. We also review free and paid APIs, plus deployment platforms like Vercel, Railway, and Hugging Face Spaces.

After Part I, You Will Be Able To:

* Describe the end-to-end flow of an AI project: from concept to deployment
* Choose between using a pretrained model locally or via a hosted API
* Identify tools that match your budget, skill level, and deployment needs
* Understand how cloud platforms and model APIs fit into modern AI workflows
* Move into project development with clarity and confidence

> *Part I is where you pause, observe the battlefield, and pick the right tools for your mission. The real building begins in Part II.*
