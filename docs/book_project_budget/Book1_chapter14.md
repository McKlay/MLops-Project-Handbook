# Chapter 14: Case Studies â€“ Meme Generator, Cartoonizer, Chatbot

You're in the final act â€” time to bring everything together. Chapter 14 is a deep dive into real AI/ML projects you've built or can build, showing how each one connects the dots between models, deployment, APIs, and scalability. These case studies serve as templates for future production-ready tools.

## Case Study 1: AI Meme Generator

*"Give me a picture. Iâ€™ll give you a laugh."*

**Objective:**
Generate witty meme captions based on user input (text/image). Uses GPT for captions.

### Stack Breakdown

| Layer        | Tool                       |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Frontend     | React (Vercel)             |
| Backend      | FastAPI (Railway)          |
| AI Model/API | OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo       |
| Hosting      | Vercel (UI), Railway (API) |

### Backend API Flow

1. Receive prompt from frontend
2. Query OpenAI with:

```python
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a witty meme caption generator."},
    {"role": "user", "content": input.prompt}
]
```

3. Return text output

### Cool Add-ons

* Limit API calls per session (cooldown)
* Generate meme template + overlay text with Pillow
* Save memes to user account (e.g., Supabase)
* Export as PNG or share link

## Case Study 2: Photo Cartoonizer

*"Convert any selfie into anime-style or cartoon art."*

**Objective:**
Transform user-uploaded image into a cartoon using AI image-to-image models.

### Stack Breakdown

| Layer        | Tool                                     |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Frontend     | Gradio or React (Hugging Face / Vercel)  |
| Backend      | FastAPI or pure Gradio                   |
| AI Model/API | Replicate API â€“ `cartoonify`, `U-GAT-IT` |
| Hosting      | Hugging Face Spaces (demo), Replicate    |

### Image Inference Flow

1. User uploads image
2. Backend calls Replicate with:

```python
replicate.run(
    "tstramer/cartoonify:latest",
    input={"image": open(image_path, "rb")}
)
```

3. Display output URL/image in frontend

### Cool Add-ons

* Compare original vs cartoon (split view)
* Add filters (sepia, comic, black & white)
* Export to social media templates (Instagram post, story)

## Case Study 3: Swift Chat AI

*"A chatbot that remembers your vibes and chats naturally."*

**Objective:**
Create a simple chatbot UI that talks like a buddy, mentor, or assistant.

### Stack Breakdown

| Layer        | Tool                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Frontend     | React + Chat Bubbles (Vercel)        |
| Backend      | FastAPI                              |
| AI Model/API | OpenAI GPT-3.5 or Claude (Anthropic) |
| Hosting      | Railway (API) + Vercel (UI)          |

### Chatbot Flow

1. Frontend sends message
2. Backend builds conversation context
3. Sends to GPT:

```python
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an empathetic mentor..."}]
```

4. Returns chatbot response â†’ updates UI

### Cool Add-ons

* Memory: persist chat history per user
* Mood: toggle between funny, formal, or technical tone
* Voice: use text-to-speech (TTS) to read replies
* Auth: login with Google + per-user chat logs

## Common Threads in All Projects

| Element                  | Importance                         |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `.env` for secrets       | Security for API keys              |
| `.gitignore`             | Avoid leaking local files & `venv` |
| Deployment CI/CD         | Fast shipping via GitHub + Railway |
| Logs + limits            | Control cost and debug issues      |
| Modular folder structure | Enables multi-feature expansion    |

---

## Project Packaging & Showcasing

Every project should include:

* âœ… `README.md` (with badges + demo link + screenshots)
* âœ… `requirements.txt` + `.env.example`
* âœ… Clean folder structure (`backend/`, `frontend/`)
* âœ… GitHub project board for task breakdown

## Next-Level Ideas (Pick One to Expand)

| Project Idea         | Description                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| AI Sound Bender      | Add music filters using AI models (DDSP, etc.)  |
| FaceSwap Video Tool  | Swap faces using lightweight face-mesh models   |
| AutoSlogan Generator | GPT-based product tagline/slogan creator        |
| Anime Frame Restorer | Use ESRGAN + restoration pipeline for upscaling |

> Each of these can use your current stack + one new model/API!
